# Le Perfum√® Merci

This is a side project which is meant to suggest a some fragrances based on selected scents. The entire project is in collaboration with a design student,  but as of now, the basic design and functionality is implementet by me.

## The Framework

The application is programmed using typescript, where the backend is done in Node.sj, and the frontend is done in React.js


## The API

The API used is [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/). The primary function here is to send the prompts to this API, and receive a result that can be displayed on the application.


### Future APIs

To improve the quality of the application, it would be nice to have pictures of the suggested fragrances, so in the future i will try using the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to search for photos. 


## Screenshots

**Here are some screenshots of the application itself:**

## DEMO
The demo has a watermark due to the compressing, so that it could fit here :)
