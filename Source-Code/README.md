# React workshop
The contents for a React course for building an OpenAI application that generates a recipe based on ingredients. See the [step-by-step guide](./step-by-step.md) to get started.

## How to run the app
The project is divided into two parts, backend and frontend. The backend is located in the `backend` folder, while the frontend is located in the root folder.

## Starting up the frontend
To start up the frontend, first run the following command from the terminal to install the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then, from the same terminal you can start up the frontend with the following command:
```
npm start
```

## Starting up the backend
To start up the backend, first navigate to the `backend` folder, e.g. with `cd backend`. Once you are inside the `backend` folder, first run the following command from the terminal to install the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then, from the same terminal you can start up the frontend with the following command:
```
npm start
```
